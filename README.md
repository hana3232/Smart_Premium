## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for modeling
- XGBoost / Random Forest / Linear Regression (Model comparisons)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (Optional for deployment interface)

## 🔧 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and data types
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature engineering

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Trend analysis, correlation, visual insights

3. **Model Building**
   - Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
   - Train-test split and cross-validation

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - R² Score, MAE, RMSE

5. **Deployment Ready**
   - Script modularization for future Streamlit or Flask integration

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Health Score, Income, and Policy Type had high correlation with premium amounts.
- Customers with better credit scores and no prior claims tend to have lower premiums.
- The model achieved an R² Score of **`[your_score_here]`** with the **`[your_best_model_here]`** algorithm.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Integrate with real-time data via APIs.
- Deploy on Streamlit with interactive UI.
- Enhance prediction accuracy using deep learning models.
